Recently, I've been tinkering with quick ways to get a web page built and deployed.
Given my background and skillset, I've come to the conclusion that Next.js with Vercel deployments works best.

With Next, I've got a framework where I can very easily build out a React front-end, selecting client or server side rendering on a page by page basis.
Next even has a built in simple back-end that can be used with very little configuration.

Vercel lets me easily deploy these apps right off of my github commits without having to worry about hosting; I'm still using their free version as it's sufficient for my purposes.

I had been touching on other languages and frameworks such as Ruby on Rails and even C# with Blazor, but I think Next currently offers me the best support and ease of use.

Give Next.js a try with Vercel and see what you think!
