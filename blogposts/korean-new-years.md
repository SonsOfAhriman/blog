I had great fun celebrating **Korean New Year** with my wife's family in Incheon.

We had some ceremonies between the kids and the grandparents, and enjoyed a huge spread of traditional Korean dishes.
I'm going to try to get image upload functionality working for my blog later on so I can share some of the photos I took!
